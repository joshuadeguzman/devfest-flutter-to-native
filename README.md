# Devfest Flutter Integration
by [Joshua M. de Guzman](https://joshdeguzman.com)

A demonstrable flutter integration into an existing codebase, with the help of platform channels.

> DISCLAIMER: Since Flutter's "Add-to-App" functionality is in preview, the associated APIs and tooling are not stable and are subject to change.

### About

In this session, we will be discussing the how Flutter can be beneficial for your company or projects. I will also tackle the 2 use cases on how you can integrate Flutter into an existing mobile codebase. Lastly, I will share the challenges, technical preview issues encountered while applying this process in an actual production app.

### Resources

Some docs and blog that you will need to continue your journey in maximizing Flutter Add-to-App feature.

- [Flutter Platform Channels docs](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/platform-integration/platform-channels)
- [Platform Channels Blog](https://medium.com/flutter/flutter-platform-channels-ce7f540a104e)

Another project I wrote where I introduced Google Protobuf for serializing the platform channels data.
